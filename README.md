# My First Github Project: Trebl
## Born from my desire to have an all-inclusive app for easier access on the go

This is a personal project, mainly to help with my own guitar practice. It is
supposed to house several avenues of practice:

* Buttons: Buttons that can play offline as well as a set and forget option
  * Metronome: Simple metronome for rhythm practice 
  * Timer: Simple timer for time exercises 
  * Tuner: Fully functional string instrument tuner; offers support for other 
types of instruments as well as different frequencies for selection and popular 
metal/acoustic alternate tuning presets 


* Ear Training Module: An entire module dedicated to ear training. 
Includes: 
  * Interval practice with piano keys with ascending and descending
  * Chord practice with piano keys module
  * Chord progression practice with most popular chord progressions

* Jam Module:  An entire module centered around backing tracks
  * Option of a metronome, imported from YouTube vids or simple piano 
    progressions from the app
  * Looper that takes in any recording and just loops it, perfect for if the 
  user has their own melodies

This module hammers in improvisation techniques with rounded practice and 
includes multiplt feels and genres.
