# My first Github Project
This is my first Github project, I published this straight from VSCode

I call it: Trebl

This is a personal project, mainly to help with my own guitar practice. It is
supposed to house several avenues of practice:

Metronome: Simple metronome for rhythm practice 
Time: Simple timer for time exercises 


Ear Training Module: An entire module dedicated to ear training. 
Includes: 
Interval practice with piano keys with ascending and descending
Chord practice with piano keys module
Chord progression practice with most popular chords

Jam Module: An entire module centered around backing tracks, with option of a
metronome, imported from YouTube vids or simple piano progressions from the app

This module hammers in improvisation techniques with rounded practice and 
includes multiplt feels and genres.
